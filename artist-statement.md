# Artist Statement

I chose the game: Pac Man to structure my persuasive game. I'd like to change people's original impression on this game. The pac man in my game is no longer a fixed object in a certain range of the screen controlled by key operations. I made the pac man follow player's mouse movement, which made it more lively.

Speaking of the concept which I want to persuade people of from this game can be simply divided into there parts. 
First, the ghosts are the representative of evil things, we should stay away from them in case of self danger.
Second, more important as well, in some special situations, something that is harmful to you will bring you double benefits, if and only if you have the ability or power to defeat them. Third, which is related to the limited chances each turn, (3 lives each time in game) we need to grasp every opportunity.

During normal stages of the game, the ghosts were shown in there different colors. (red, green and pink)
They are harmeful, player should control the mouse to avoid reaching the ghost. Reaching each of them will lose one life. (presented by the heart at the right corner)
Player's goal is to eat as many biscuits as they can to gain a higer score. However, when you eat one cherry, the bonus time will be activated. Random numbers of blue ghosts now were valuable not harmful. They worth 2 scores each. However they will pass real fast. Try to catch as many as you can.

So, that's all about my game, other instructions will be shown in the game or in the game, and the rules are simple. Hope you had fun~ ^_^
